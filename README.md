# Sketch-For-UX-Design

## Description
Created a wireframe in Sketch using the shape, text, and graphics tools; built reusable symbols; and incorporated styles and visual effects. Transformed design into a clickable prototype that can be viewed directly on a mobile device. Exported assets and generated style guides and design systems to keep products consistent and designs in sync. Introduced to a variety of helpful plugins and companion softwareâ€”like Sketch Measure, Zeplin, Zeroheight, and InVision.
